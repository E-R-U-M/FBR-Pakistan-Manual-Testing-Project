##  Final Result

> **Application Status**:  *Pass with Minor Issues*

Majority of test cases passed successfully. Backend-related failures must be resolved before production deployment.

---

##  Notes

- Testing performed on `https://www.paperfree.pk/fbr/Home`
- Test data is based on the current version as of October 2022.
- Issues related to backend performance, error 500s, and task assignments must be addressed by the development team before the next round of testing.
- Naming consistency and role hierarchy should be clearly documented in the system (e.g., “Chief Inspection Region Deputy” vs. “Additional Unit Twelve”).
- No automation tools were used

- ---

## 🛠 Recommendations

- Add automated regression testing for login and document workflows.
- Improve error handling to avoid generic server errors.
- Optimize database saving logic for task assignment modules.
